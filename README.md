# Recipebook

## Data Centric Development Milestone Project-3

## Description

The Recipebook is an online cookbook, where a user can find recipes or share his/her own recipes. User can create an account 
and has the possibility of add, update or delete his/her own recipes.

# UX

### Target Audience

 The target audience of this web-application are food lovers who are either in search of good cooking recipes or they want to store 
 their favourite recipes online and want to share with the rest of the world. The purpose of this web-application 
 is to provide a platform to food lovers so they can share their cooking recipes with other. Besides this the web-application
 owner's goal is to create a cooking recipes database.

### Project Suitability

This project is suitable to perform **CRUD** operations;
- Users have the ability to create, view and search for recipes in th database.
- Users have the ability to edit or delete their own recipes.
- Users can only view other's recipes but did not have the access to edit or delete other's recipes.
- User login system has put in place so that user can manage their recipes.

 ### User Stories

 1. As a user, I want to see a list / catalogue of recipes.
 2. As a user, I want to search for recipes so that I can find recipes easily and quickly.
 3. As a user, I want to be able to create an account.
 4. As a user, I want to be able to login to my account.
 5. AS a user, I want to store/add  and share my recipes online with others.
 6. As a user, I want to see a list of my own recipes.
 7. As a user, I want to see the details of the recipe.
 8. As a user, I want to update my existing recipes. 
 9. As a user, I want to delete my existing recipes.
 10. As a user, I want to end the session.

 ## Design

 The website design is simple and responsive which allows the user to perform easily theCRUD functionality. The design 
 inspiration is taken from the **Code Institute's Task Manager Mini Project**.

#### Fonts

1. Google fonts **Krona One** is used in navbar and footer. 
2. Where as **Balsamiq Sans** is used in the body. 

#### Attribute

1. The target_blank value is given to the social links in the footer so that they will open in a new tab / window on click.
2. The required attribute is used in the **Search bar**, **Log In form**, **Sign Up form**, **Add Recipe form** and **Edit Recipe form** so that user 
fill in all the fiels before performing the respective action.
3. Maximum, minimum and character counter attributes are also added in the input fields for better user experience. 

#### Hover Effect

1. Slight change in background color and default cursor changes to hand pointer happens when a user hover over a button.
2. Default cursor changes to hand pointer when a user hover over logo and social links.

## Wireframes

I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to create wireframes which will provide an overview of how the website will look 
like on different mobile screen size.

## Database Schema

NoSql MONGODB is used to store data at the backend. Database schema is designed for various collections before buiding the project. 
- [Collections Schema in PDF](static/collections/collections.pdf)

## Features
### Existing Features

- **Navbar/Side** navbar - Navbar and side navbar links vary, if user is logged in or not. If user is not logged in then Home,
All Recipes and Log In buttons are shown. Where as after login user can see Home, All Recipes, Add Recipes, My Recipes and Logout.
At login and signup pages all navbar/sidenavbar links will disappear except the logo Recipebook. 
- **All recipes** - When a user land on the home page and user has not logged in yet, user can see the list of all recipes in the database. User can also 
see the list of all recipes once the user has logged in.
- **Search** - User can search for any recipe in the database either way, without logging in or after logging in the website.
- **Register** - User can easily register if does not have an account as signup form is very simple. Signup form
form has two fields username and password. It is required that a username must be minimum of three character long and password 
should be minimum 6 character long. It is not possible to have two accounts with the same name as before registration username will be
checked if it already exist or not. If username already exist then user will be notified that username already exist with a flash message.
- **Login** - If username password does not match user will get a message that invalid username/password.
- **Flash Messages** - Flash Messages are shown to the user to keep user inform of user interactivity. Flash messages for 
login and signup will stay untill these pages are refreshed. Where as flash messages on recipe addition, deletion and update will 
disappear after 4 sec.
- **Logout** - Logout allows a user to end the session and return to the home page.
- **View** - It allows a user in session to see the details of a recipes in the database.
- **Add Recipe** - It allows a user to add a new recipe in the database. All the fields are required in add recipe form. After 
adding the recipe user will get a flash message that recipe is added successfully and will disappear after few seconds. After this 
user will be redirected to the all recipes page.
- **Edit/Delete Recipe** - When user is logged in user can edit or delete a recipe which he owns.
- **Edit/Delete Buttons**- Edit/Delete buttons will appear only if the user is the owner of that particular recipe.
- **Cancel Button** - Cancel button is provied in edit recipe page for user's convenience to cancel the operation which will 
redirect the user back to that particular recipe that user was viewing before.
- **Deletion Confirmation**- If a user click on delete button, then a modal will pop up to confirm if user is sure to delete the recipe or not.
- **My Recipe** - If user want to see his own added recipes then **My Recipe** function will  display the list of user's own recipe.
- **Error handler(404), try and except** - If user enters broken url, then for better user experience an errorhandler(404) is added. This will
display a message **Oops! Looks like you entered wrong URL**. It will also provide link to the home page for user convenience.

### Features Left to Implement

- **Pagination** - At the moment **All Recipes** and **My Recipes** pages just list all the recipes on the same page. But in 
in future I would like to add pagination so that a few number of recipes can be shown on the page and remain on page 2 or 
page 3 etc.
- **Graphs** - I would like add graphs in future to give a statistical overview of the recipes.
- **Reset Password** - A reset password feature will be added in the future.
- **Recover Password** - Password recovery feature if forgotten will also be added in future.
- **Recipe Image** - To make recipe visually appealing, recipe image addition option will also be added.
- **Sort** - Sorting recipes accending or decending order feature will also be added in future.
- In the **Input form** fields, user can insert content without giving spaces as a single line entry and can add the recipe in the
 database. When later this recipe is viewed then it is displayed in a weird way as text will be overlapping out of the text fields.
 To overcome this I need to either add some complex Regular Expressions to the pattern or some keystroke queries using JavaScript,
 that I left for future.

### Interesting Bugs / Issue

1. **Add Recipe function stopped working** - I encountered a very interesting bug when I made datepicker field a required 
field. I also wanted to show a feedback message to the user. To achieve this, I added a **JavaScript** function which I took from **Stack overflow**. 
But later I realized that **Add Recipe** function is not working. Since I used **Git** version control so I start going back to
the previous versions of my project to find out after which commit **Add Recipe** button stopped working. At last I found out
that its the **JavaScript** function that is causing this issue. So I replaced it with a **JQuery code** and solved this issue.
2. **Recipes can be stolen / Edited** - A very interesting bug that one of my friend **Elliot Redhead** point out was that a user can 
steal someone else's recipe and can edit / delete. Although edit / delete button are ment to display only to recipe owner.
Process of stealing recipe was;
- First view someone else's recipe and copy the recipe ID from the URL.
- Now open your own recipe in edit recipe page.
- Remove your recipe's ID and paste someone else's recipe ID.
- Press Enter now can edit someone els's recipe.
- **Solution** - To overcome this issue I need to update my edit recipe function. I put a check over there that will first see 
if the user who is trying to access the edit recipe page is the owner of the recipe. If **yes** then the function will let user
to proceed to edit recipe page else user will be redirected to the home page.
3. **No Recipe Found** - If a user in session does not have any own recipe then **No Recipe Found** message is displayed but
in the beginning this message has been also displayed in **All recipes**. To overcome this issue I need to amend my **Search Recipe**
function and **My Recipes** function togeather with if statement in recipes.html. Credit goes to Tim who helped me to fix this issue.
4. **Flash Messages** - Flash messages were not appearing after a delay of few seconds on **Adding Recipe**, **Updating Recipe**
and **Deleting Recipe** I realized later that, I need to hide it first then delay and it worked.
5. **Carousel** - I found out that if user keep click on or on touch screen keep pressing the **Carousel (Image Slider)**
then the images starts flashing. I did not tried to fix it and it remains there.
6.  In the **Input form** fields, user can insert content without giving spaces as a single line entry and add the recipe in the
 database. When later this recipe is viewed then it is displayed in a weird way as text will be overlapping out of the text fields.
 To overcome this I need to either add some complex Regular Expressions to the pattern or some keystroke queries using JavaScript,
 that I left for future.
